# Metropogen
Copyright (c) 2018 Theodore Mason

Metropogen is (will be) a Python-based application to model the actions of 
a populace in a fantasy city. It is intended to be used to create snapshot 
descriptions and not to model long-term behaviors and consequences (yet).

Planned features:

    - Multi-layer (aristocratic, infrastructure, crime, government, etc)
        description of actions over a 24-hour period

    - Settings to tweak layer priorities (more "crime" actions, more "faith"
        actions, etc) or turn off layers (no aristocratic layer); change 
        size of city used (metropolis, city, large town, small town, village,
        township, hamlet, etc)

    - generation of "landmarks," locations that layers interact with that
        would be prominent in city

    - output to text file in useful format

Stretch Goals:

    - read in user landmarks and use them at runtime

    - create setting "skins" like cyberpunk, low-magic fantasy, high-magic 
        fantasy, industrial era, etc that vastly change descriptions

    - create GUI version
